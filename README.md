signalr-di-examples
===================

SignalR with Dependency Injection, using Ninject and Unity.

That's said, we made this two examples. Feel free to expand them making available for all the IoC available somewhere.
Hope this helps.

We have been using SignalR for almost a year now. The lack of DI on our project make us worry, 
so we search for a nice and easy integration with any of the IoC available for C#, none of them easily integrated 
with SignalR and the only solution found on the web (from the developers of SignalR) can be found 
[here] (http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/extensibility/dependency-injection) and is only for 
Ninject (which we dont use due to its beta/alpha state and lately lack of support - I know it changed lately, but we were 
unsure where was it heading).
